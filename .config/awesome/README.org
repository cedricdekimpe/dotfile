* Awesome
My awesome rice contains two themes

| Name | Description                                                                                                 | Picture                          |
|------+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+----------------------------------|
| Fox  | My first "real" rice. Has awesome colors, terminal theme, gtk-theme (in =.config/oomox=) and [[https://t.me/addtheme/dy3q98gjaQaBxoQE][telegram]] theme | [[file:.dotfiles-pictures/fox.png]]  |
| Nord | A nord-based theme. Colors for terminal, custom prompt, awesome colors and custom telegram theme.           | [[file:.dotfiles-pictures/nord.png]] |

The theme I'm using right now and is preconfigured is nord
You can use it out of the box and it should work as expected for
terminal applications. The prompt I use is [[https://github.com/noaccOS/pure][here]]
To theme GUI programs you can use these themes:
- [[https://github.com/EliverLara/Nordic][GTK Theme]]
- [[https://github.com/noaccOS/telegram-nord-theme][Telegram Theme]]
- [[https://github.com/ralphSQ/Nord-minimal-functional-fox][Firefox-css]]
- [[https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/noaccos-nord/][Firefox theme]]
- [[https://gist.github.com/dhilln/f74098c730659cd7d9fd4e4e15f5b8cd][Discord]]

** Dependencies
To get the most out of the rice, you're adviced to get all the required
dependencies
The list is for Arch Linux packages, the links are git links so you can
search informations for your distribution

| Arch name (embedded git link) | Usage / Description                     | Comment                                                                                                                                                                                          |

** Warning
Some applications are set to always open in certain tags and/or
monitors
If you experience errors, consider editing/removing the lines in
=.config/awesome/rc.lua=

#+begin_src lua
  -- Tag rules
  { rule = { instance = "telegram-desktop"},
    properties = {screen = 2, tag = "1"}},
  { rule = { class = "discord"},
    properties = {screen = 2, tag = "2"}},
  { rule = { class = "[sS]potify"},
    properties = {screen = 2}},
#+end_src

Also, some applications are set to *autostart*
They are launched from the last line in =rc.lua= (=autostart()=)

** Autostart function
It doesn't work es expected, the first and second argument for now do
the same thing, in future I hope to fix that

| Argument                | What it does                                                                            |
|-------------------------+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| First argument (string) | The program to launch with focus                                                        |
| Second argument (table) | Launch the other programs, without steling the focus from the first (rn they do though) |
| Third argument (table)  | Launch programs with a shell, useful for more complex commands like the polkit          |
